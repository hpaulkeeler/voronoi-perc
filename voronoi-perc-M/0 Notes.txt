To create a street system, run

[streetVoronoi,endVoronoi]=funStreetVoronoiPoisson(lambdaS,scaleLength);

where lambdaS>0 is intensity (or average density) of a (spatial) Poisson point proces and scaleLength > 0 is the side of square simulation window.

To generate users on the streets, run

userPoisson=funUserPoisson(streetVoronoi,lambdaU);

where lambdaU is the intensity (or average density) of a (linear) Poisson point process.

To generate relays at crossroads (or street intersections), run

relayBinomial=funRelayBinomial(endVoronoi,pRelay);

where 0 <= pRelay <=1 is the probability of a relay being at a crossroads (or street intersection).
